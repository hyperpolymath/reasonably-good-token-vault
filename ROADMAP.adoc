== Version 1.0.0 Blockers

The following MUST be completed before v1.0.0 release:

=== Critical Path

1. *Implement flat GUID storage* - No folder creation in data container
2. *Implement name/variable redaction* - Hash all identifying information
3. *Build two-container architecture* - Data and delivery containers
4. *Implement API socket isolation* - Only communication path
5. *Implement credential assembly* - Delivery container assembles from fragments
6. *Complete Ada CLI/TUI* - Primary user interface
7. *Write comprehensive tests* - Unit, integration, property-based
8. *Write threat model* - Document security assumptions
9. *Third-party security audit* - External verification

=== Estimated Work

[NOTE]
====
These are engineering tasks, not time estimates. Scheduling is the responsibility of contributors and maintainers.
====

* Flat GUID storage: Modify CUBS integration, XTDB queries
* Redaction system: Implement hash lookup table, redact/reveal functions
* Two-container architecture: Split current container, implement API socket IPC
* Ada CLI/TUI: Complete svalinn-cli implementation
* Testing: Write tests to match current specification
* Documentation: Complete API docs, threat model

== Future Versions

=== Version 1.1.0 (Post-Launch)

* Hardware security module (HSM) support
* Yubikey/FIDO2 integration
* Hardware wallet integration (Ledger, Trezor)
* Improved agrep fuzzy matching
* Pandoc name translation pipeline
* aspell/hunspell dictionary integration

=== Version 1.2.0 (Platform Expansion)

* iOS/Android support via Tauri 2.0
* macOS Keychain integration
* Windows Credential Manager bridge
* Biometric authentication (Touch ID, Face ID)

=== Version 2.0.0 (Advanced Features)

* Distributed vault federation
* Multi-party computation (MPC) for key splitting
* Threshold signatures (t-of-n)
* Zero-knowledge proof authentication
* Homomorphic encryption for cloud backup

=== Version 2.1.0 (Enterprise)

* LDAP/Active Directory integration
* SAML/OIDC federation
* Audit trail with blockchain anchoring
* Compliance reporting (SOC2, HIPAA)

== Liability Minimization

=== Legal Safeguards

To minimize liability, this project:

1. *Provides no warranties* - "AS IS" distribution
2. *Makes no security claims* - Users assume all risk
3. *Requires independent audit* - Before production use
4. *Documents all limitations* - Transparent about what it cannot do
5. *Includes export warnings* - Dual-use technology acknowledgment

=== Technical Safeguards

1. *No storage of plaintext* - Everything encrypted at rest
2. *No network exposure* - API socket only
3. *No persistent secrets in memory* - Zeroed after use
4. *No logging of credentials* - Redaction in all logs
5. *No default configurations* - User must explicitly configure

=== Contributor Protections

1. *SPDX headers required* - Clear licensing
2. *Signed commits required* - Attribution chain
3. *No proprietary dependencies* - FOSS only
4. *No cloud services* - Self-hosted only

== Security Considerations

=== What This Project IS

* A local, offline-first identity vault
* A post-quantum prepared credential store
* A maximally paranoid security implementation
* A defense-in-depth architecture example

=== What This Project IS NOT

* A password manager (use Bitwarden, etc.)
* A secrets management service (use Vault, SOPS)
* A production-ready enterprise solution (needs audit)
* A silver bullet for security

=== Known Limitations

1. *Side-channel attacks* - Not resistant to physical access
2. *Quantum computers* - Future cryptanalytic advances may succeed
3. *Implementation bugs* - Software may contain undiscovered flaws
4. *Human error* - Social engineering bypasses technical controls
5. *Legal compulsion* - Cryptography cannot protect against court orders

=== Recommended Use Cases

* Personal credential storage
* Developer token management
* Research and education
* Security architecture reference

=== Not Recommended For

* Nation-state threat models (use air-gapped systems)
* High-value financial secrets (use HSMs)
* Regulated industries (needs compliance certification)
* Non-technical users (complex setup required)

== Contributing to the Roadmap

See link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] for contribution guidelines.

Roadmap items can be proposed via:

1. GitHub Issues (for non-security items)
2. Security email (for security-related proposals)
3. Pull requests with implementation

All roadmap changes require maintainer approval and security review.
