Abstract:
We present Svalinn Vault, a post-quantum secure identity storage system designed for hostile computing environments. The system employs a novel dual-container architecture with GUID-based storage and redaction-until-delivery to minimize attack surface and information leakage. Cryptographic primitives include NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms (ML-KEM/Kyber-1024, ML-DSA/Dilithium5), combined with classical algorithms (Ed448, AES-256-GCM, BLAKE3, Argon2id) in a hybrid construction. We introduce a lockdown protocol featuring chmod 000 permissions, chroot isolation, and quantum-seeded polymorphic obfuscation that renders memory forensics practically infeasible. The system is implemented in ATS (Applied Type System) with Zig bindings, leveraging dependent types for compile-time security verification. Our threat model assumes a hostile environment with potential physical access, side-channel attacks, and post-quantum adversaries.
