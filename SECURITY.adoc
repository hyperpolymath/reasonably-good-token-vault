*Your secrets deserve better protection than a password manager can offer.*

== What Svalinn Vault Protects

Svalinn Vault keeps your digital identities safe. This includes:

- *SSH keys* for secure server access
- *PGP/GPG keys* for encrypted email and file signing
- *API tokens* for GitHub, GitLab, cloud services
- *OAuth credentials* for third-party apps
- *Certificates* for website and code signing
- *WireGuard keys* for VPN connections

Each credential gets a unique ID (GUID) and stays encrypted until you actually need it. Names and details are scrambled even inside the vault. An attacker who breaks in sees only meaningless strings of letters and numbers.

== How We Keep Your Data Safe

=== Multiple Layers of Encryption

Your credentials pass through several protection layers:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Protection |What It Does

|*Argon2id*
|Turns your password into a strong encryption key. Uses 64 MB of memory to stop password-guessing attacks.

|*Kyber-1024*
|Quantum-resistant encryption. Stays secure even against future quantum computers.

|*AES-256-GCM*
|Military-grade encryption used by governments and banks worldwide.

|*BLAKE3*
|Fast, secure hashing for verification. Catches any tampering instantly.

|*Dilithium5*
|Quantum-resistant signatures. Proves data hasn't been modified.
|===

=== Network Protection

Svalinn Vault uses IPv6 connections only. All IPv4 traffic gets blocked. This removes most internet attack methods.

The vault connects through AirVPN using WireGuard encryption. Even your internet provider can't see what you're doing.

Fake honeypot services run on common attack ports (22, 80, 443). Any attacker scanning your system triggers alerts before reaching real services.

=== Access Control

- *Multi-factor authentication* blocks unauthorised access
- *Time-locked access windows* limit when credentials can be read
- *Anti-AI CAPTCHA* stops automated attacks
- *Variable login delays* prevent brute-force guessing
- *Automatic lockout* after failed attempts

=== File Security

When locked:

- All vault files get *chmod 000* permissions (completely inaccessible)
- The vault runs inside a *chroot jail* with minimal access
- *SELinux* enforces strict access rules
- *Code obfuscation* scrambles memory contents

== Reporting Security Issues

Found a vulnerability? We want to hear about it.

=== How to Report

*DO NOT* open public GitHub issues for security problems. This protects other users until we fix the issue.

Instead, email us directly:

----
security@hyperpolymath.example
----

Our PGP key fingerprint:

----
[To be published when infrastructure is in place]
----

=== What to Include

Your report should contain:

1. *Clear description* of the vulnerability
2. *Steps to reproduce* the issue
3. *Expected vs actual behaviour*
4. *Your assessment* of severity and impact
5. *Any suggested fixes* (optional but helpful)

=== Response Timeline

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Timeframe |Our Commitment

|*24 hours*
|We acknowledge your report

|*72 hours*
|Initial assessment complete

|*7 days*
|Detailed investigation done

|*30 days*
|Fix developed and tested

|*45 days*
|Public disclosure (coordinated with you)
|===

We aim to beat these times. Complex issues may take longer.

== Bug Bounty Programme

=== The Honest Truth

Here's the thing: we'd *love* to run a proper bug bounty programme. Security researchers deserve fair payment for finding vulnerabilities. Good bug bounty programmes pay thousands of pounds for critical issues.

We can't do that right now.

Independent open-source developers don't have venture capital backing. We're not a Silicon Valley startup with millions in funding. We're building security software because people deserve better tools than what's currently available.

=== What We Can Offer

*Currently (Unfunded):*

- Public acknowledgement in our Hall of Fame
- CVE credit with your name
- A sincere thank-you and our genuine gratitude
- Our commitment to fix issues promptly

*If Funded in Future:*

We would immediately establish proper bounties:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Severity |Potential Bounty

|Critical (RCE, key exposure)
|£2,000 - £10,000

|High (auth bypass, data leak)
|£500 - £2,000

|Medium (limited impact)
|£100 - £500

|Low (minor issues)
|£25 - £100
|===

*Funding Options:*

- link:https://github.com/sponsors/hyperpolymath[GitHub Sponsors]
- link:https://opencollective.com/hyperpolymath[Open Collective]
- Cryptocurrency: See link:FUNDING.yml[FUNDING.yml]

Every contribution moves us closer to properly rewarding security researchers.

_Yes, it's a bit ridiculous that security-critical software relies on goodwill when venture-backed apps with cute mascots get millions. But here we are. We're doing what we can with what we have._

== Security Practices

=== What We Do

- *Regular dependency audits* using cargo-audit, npm-audit
- *Static analysis* with CodeQL and custom linters
- *Fuzzing* with libFuzzer and Echidna
- *Formal verification* using Z3 and Coq provers
- *Memory-safe languages* (Rust, ATS, Zig) with no unsafe code in security paths
- *Signed commits* required for all changes
- *Code review* by multiple maintainers before merge

=== What We Don't Do

- No telemetry or analytics
- No phone-home features
- No cloud sync (your data stays local)
- No third-party authentication services
- No closed-source components
- No dependencies without security review

== Known Limitations

We believe in honest communication:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Limitation |Mitigation

|*Side-channel attacks*
|Constant-time crypto implementations used where available

|*Physical access*
|Beyond our threat model - use full-disk encryption

|*Memory forensics*
|Memory zeroing on lock, but cold boot attacks possible

|*Quantum computers*
|Kyber-1024 provides estimated protection; cryptography evolves

|*Supply chain*
|SHA-pinned dependencies; but ultimate trust required somewhere
|===

No security system is perfect. We tell you what ours can and cannot do.

== Threat Model

=== In Scope

- Remote network attacks
- Malware on the same system
- Stolen encrypted backups
- Compromised cloud storage
- Future quantum computer attacks
- Credential stuffing attacks
- Insider threats with user access

=== Out of Scope

- Nation-state attackers with physical access
- Hardware implants
- $5 wrench attacks (coercion)
- Malware with root access before vault installation
- Vulnerabilities in the operating system kernel

== Compliance

Svalinn Vault is designed with these standards in mind:

- *OWASP* guidelines for secure storage
- *NIST* post-quantum cryptography recommendations
- *FIPS 140-3* algorithm requirements (where applicable)
- *GDPR* data protection principles

Formal certification is not currently pursued (costs money we don't have).
