# The Palimpsest License

## Overlay License for Open Source Software

Version 1.0 - 2025

### Preamble

The Palimpsest License is designed to be used as an **overlay** on top of existing
open source licenses (such as AGPL-3.0, MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.). Like the ancient
palimpsests where new text was written over older manuscripts, this license adds
additional protections and ethical considerations without replacing the underlying
license.

### IMPORTANT

This license does NOT replace the underlying license. The base license (AGPL-3.0,
MIT, or other as specified) remains in full force. This overlay adds additional
terms that users and contributors are encouraged to follow.

   data protection principles.

3. **Contribute Back**: When making improvements, consider contributing them back
   to the community, even if not legally required by the base license.

4. **Attribute Properly**: Give proper credit to original authors and contributors.

5. **Document Changes**: Clearly document any modifications made to the software.

### Disclaimer

This overlay license:

- Does NOT create any legally binding obligations beyond the base license
- Does NOT modify the permissions, conditions, or limitations of the base license
- Represents aspirational goals and community expectations
